 test ground for multiprocess gui


List to be:

1) Running frequency should actually be the shear rate. (shear rate controlled experiment)
2) Interchangeable time monitor (for example (first two seconds)) to see the impulse response. Important for rheology. 
3) Dimension of the plate(alpha) so we can take the shear rate as our input
4) In the future, the phase difference of the coils should be automtically changed depending on the shear stress (Regelung)
(stress controlled experiment)
