**************************************************************

/STM_SRC_CODE/again_try/CM7/Src/main.c is the MAIN SOURCE CODE FILE, RUN HERE!.

for filtering source code, check conv-direct.c and conv-direct.h for headers file.

Toolchain : 
i)            STM32CubeIDE (original toolchain)
ii)           VSCode with STM32CubeMX extension, clangd for compiler front-end, arm-none-eabi-gcc from ARM GNU for on-board chip flashing,
              ST-Link GBD for debugging tool-chain, CMake for cross-compile software development


STM32CubeIDE is recommended as it requires the least amount of step needed to compile, debug and flash the code onto the chips, 
but the IDE is very slow in this case.
